	<h1>Manchester United FC</h1>
	<p class="info">Manchester United is one of the most prestigious football clubs and has always maintained a distinguished tradition, a record of consistent success, and a great history. They are together with Liverpool, England's most successful football clubs ever. "The Red Devils" have more national titles than Liverpool, but the rival has collected more titles in international tournaments.</p>

	<h2 class="hh2">History</h2>
	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="oldphoto" src="mu1878.jpg" alt="MU 1878">
		<p class="history">	Manchester was one of the fastest growing cities during the Industrial Revolution and much so due to a torrent of workers arriving from different parts of the British Islands. From a relatively small town in the beginning of the 19th century, Manchester had passed one million inhabits by 1900 and had become one of the biggest cities in Europe. It was great conditions for football clubs to emerge; the sport was after all, in its early history to a big degree dominated by workers. The club that later would become Manchester United FC was initially founded in the year 1878, named as Newton Heath L&YR Football Club. L&YR as in Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, which were the company there the team's player worked.<br><br>
		The team played in the Football League for the very first time in 1892 (they should not be confused with Manchester Football Club, founded in 1860 and participated in the FA Cup in the 1870s before shifting to Rugby). But, they were relegated after two years. Next, a new group of local businessmen then took over the roles and responsibilities of the club and named it as Manchester United in 1902. The newly named club won the title of English League in 1908 under the guidance of Ernest Mangnall. The first FA Cup trophy was obtained the following year. The team then shifted to the current stadium, Old Trafford in 1910.<br><br>
		After the Second World War, the club had witnessed an extended spell with the appointment of Matt Busby in 1945. This visionary leader completely reshaped the club and placed a new faith in youngsters, and this strategy eventually proved to be astonishingly successful.<br><br>
		The United team would win the league in 1955–56 and 1956–57. The average age were 21 at the first occasion, which made it the youngest side ever to win the Football League and earned them the nickname the “Busby Babes”.</p>

	<h2 class="hh2">The plane crash</h2>
	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="airplane" src="air.jpg" alt="Aircrash">
		<p class="planecrush">The Munich air disaster occurred on 6 February 1958 when British European Airways Flight 609 crashed on its third attempt to take off from a slush-covered runway at Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany. The aircraft was carrying the Manchester United football team, nicknamed the "Busby Babes", along with supporters and journalists.[1] There were 44 people on board, 20 of whom died at the scene. The injured, some unconscious, were taken to the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich where three more died, resulting in 23 fatalities with 21 survivors.<br><br>
		The team was returning from a European Cup match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, having eliminated Red Star Belgrade to advance to the semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the range of the "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador. After refuelling, pilots James Thain and Kenneth Rayment twice abandoned take-off because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would fall too far behind schedule, Captain Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By that time, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form at the end of the runway. After hitting the slush, the aircraft ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway and the left wing was torn off when it struck a house. The tail section broke off and hit a barn with a parked fuel truck in it, that caught fire and exploded. Fearing the aircraft too might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers while Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg helped pull survivors from the wreckage.<br><br>
		An investigation by West German airport authorities originally blamed Thain, saying he did not de-ice the aircraft's wings, despite eyewitness statements indicating that de-icing was unnecessary. It was later established that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway, which slowed the plane too much to enable take-off. Thain was cleared in 1968, ten years after the incident.<br><br>
		Manchester United were aiming to become the third club to win three successive Football League titles; they were six points behind league leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers with 14 games still to play. They also held the FA Charity Shield and had just advanced into their second successive European Cup semi-finals. The team had not been beaten for 11 matches. The crash not only derailed the team's title ambitions that year but also destroyed the nucleus of what promised to be one of the greatest generations of players in English football history. It took ten years for the club to recover after the tragedy. Busby rebuilt the team and won the European Cup in 1968 with a new generation of "Babes".</p>

	<h2 class="hh2">The Alex Ferguson era</h2>
	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="siralex" src="siralex.jpg" alt="Sir Alex Ferguson">
		<p class="alexf">Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to claim that competition for the first time as well. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first "Double" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.<br><br>
		In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – "The Treble" – in the same season. Losing 1–0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.<br><br>
		In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.<br><br>
		Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining the title in 2002–03. They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008–09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.<br><br>
		After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.<br><br>
		On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager in football history.</p>

	<h2 class="hh2">Glazer takeover and "Merchandise United"</h2>

	<p class="glazer">Between 2003 and 2005, the American businessman Malcolm Glazer bought enough shares to become the new owner of the Manchester club. The new ownership was remarkable unpopular among the fans. But despite the controversial turmoil after the takeover of the Glazer family, the team continued to grow as a great team while maintaining its esteemed tradition and having a huge international follower base. During 2013-2014, it was recognized as the 2nd highest-earning club across the world with an estimated revenue of around €518 million. In fact, it was further named as the third most valuable football club in 2015.<br><br>
	The club has been clever in marketing its brand in many fields. Manchester United have been the most successful soccer team in the world to earn money from brand-name products, which have earned them the not so flattering nickname "Merchandise United".</p>
	
	<h2 class="hh2">Post-Ferguson: period of decline</h2>
	<p class="postalexf">When Alex Ferguson departed permanently from the post he had 1986-2013 the team's result would decline. None of David Moyes, Ryan Giggs and the reputable Louis van Gaal, in the manager role, could repeat the successful Ferguson formula.<br><br>
	For the 2016/2017 season José Mourinho was appointed a manager with three years contract. This was a state of the club's ambition to continue to expand its capacity, maintain its on-field success and unbeatable winning record and hold its royal legacy.</p>

	<h2 class="hh2">Logo</h2>
	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="mulogo" src="mulogo.png" alt="MU Logo">
		<p class="logo">The upper part of the inner shield of the Manchester United crest displays a ship that actually originates from the Manchester City Council coat of arms (a ship can likewise be found on Manchester City’s logo). Below the ship, there is a bigger drawing depicting a devil – the devil was first incorporated on the crest in 1970. A minor change was done in 1998 when "Football Club" was removed from the bottom banner. Instead, the banners only text out "Manchester United".</p>
